GEM is a diverse collection of environments for training LLM agents in the era of experience. The library includes Math, Code, general reasoning, and question-answering environments, as well as a suite of games (Mastermind, Minesweeper, Hangman, etc). GEM also features fully integrated python and search tool use.

## Installation

TO BE ADDED

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started. The interface closely follows [Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and other popular RL environment suites.

Environments can be initialized with `make()` (or `make_vec()`  for parallelization) and each environment hasÂ `Env.reset()`,Â `Env.step()`Â andÂ `Env.sample_random_action()` functions.

```python
import gem

# Initialize the environment
env = make("ta:GuessTheNumber-v0")

# Reset the environment to generate the first observation
observation, info = env.reset()
for _ in range(30):
    action = env.sample_random_action() # insert policy here

    # apply action and receive next observation, reward
    # and whether the episode has ended
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    # If the episode has ended then reset to start a new episode
    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()
```

## Training Agents

GEM includes __single file__ examples for training an LLM agent through `oat` or `verl` framework.

</div>

The [OAT](https://github.com/sail-sg/oat) framework provides a comprehensive solution for training language model agents in reinforcement learning environments.

The [VERL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) framework offers another approach to training agents with different optimization strategies and capabilities.
